Arkhash is a SHA-256 cryptocurrency that utilises a blockchain database and a peer-to-peer, decentralized networking model that lets you cut out the middleman in performing transactions. Arkhash is backed by the time and energy input by miners, not based on debt like many current fiat currencies. Due to the law of supply and demand, the value of Arkhash cannot deflate.
